    paragrow:
      'Factoring fees come in all shapes and sizes. Basically, there are two categories for fee structure, the fixed-rate and the variable rate. Rates typically run between 1.5% to 5% depending on the factoring company and your factoring risk. Low-risk clients who factor in larger dollar amounts are more likely to receive a lower factoring fee than a client who factors in a lower dollar amount. The fee to factor is also subject to the amount of liability you, the carrier, choose to take on along with the risk of the load and your track record (do you submit your invoices in a timely manner?). As a single owner-operator or an owner of a small trucking company with less than 4 trucks, we suggest negotiating a fixed rate fee structure. A fixed-rate is easier to budget your expenses and you do not have to worry about meeting a certain quota each week to keep your variable rate from increasing.'

    title: "What are the hidden costs?",
    paragrow:
      `ACH transfer fee – a factoring company will charge you a fee to put money into your bank account. This fee can range from $3 to $25 depending on the terms of your contract.  You may pay a per-day ACH fee or a per invoice ACH fee.  Our advice is to make sure you understand the terms of your contract before signing on the dotted line.
      Aging Invoice Fee– If the broker takes too long to pay the invoice, your factoring company may charge you an aging fee.
       Minimum factored amount fee – A factoring company may charge you a surcharge if you do not meet the required factored amount or a minimum number of factored invoices for the set period of time.
      Credit check fee – The broker you are hauling for will be credit checked by your M&J Dispatcher and your factoring company.  Some factoring companies will charge you a fee for this service.
      Early Termination Fee- A factoring company will require you to sign for a length of terms in your contract.  That length of terms could be 3 to 6 months or even 1 year. If you decide to stop factoring before your contract is up, you could be charged a fee of $1,000 to $5,000.  We advise that you know what is in your contract before committing to any length of terms.`

      "What would prevent my business from getting approved for factoring?    ",
    paragrow:
    `1. You may need to meet a minimum credit score (which is determined by your factoring company) to be eligible.  This is not common, so if this is an issue for you, we advise you keep looking until you find a factoring company that will accept you.
     2. Your trucking company will need to provide a yearly projected income, this will determine your rate. This is also known as your sales volume.
     3. Your total number of customers will influence your rate.  The more diverse your customer base, the more likely you will be hauling freight all year long.
     4. The size of your invoices.  Factoring companies like larger invoices versus smaller invoices.  It costs a factoring company more money to collect on several smaller invoices than one large invoice.  The larger your invoices are the lower your rate will be.  This basically means you want to run longer hauls versus shorter hauls.
     5. The length of time your customer takes to pay can affect your rate, the sooner the customer pays the lower your rate will be.
     6. It is important that your clients are credit worthy, factoring companies will not accept invoices from clients who they don’t think will pay.
     Some of these will not prevent eligibility but they WILL increase your rate with the factoring company. `

      "Do I have to factor every load? Is there a minimum factored amount per month?    ",
    paragrow: `Some brokers will offer a quick-pay option on THEIR loads which pay you for the invoice minus a small fee. The small fee is typically anywhere between 1% to 7%. You will usually receive this payment within 1 to 5 business days. However, we have heard it can take much longer to get paid.

      What are the pros/cons of using quick-pay?
      
       The biggest advantage to using quick-pay is NO CONTRACTS.
      Not all brokers offer the quick-pay service, therefore, limiting you to which broker you can haul for and ultimately which loads you can take.
      The biggest con we can see is that your options are limited to which loads you can haul.
      You also need to be very organized to do quick-pay.  You will quick-pay with multiple brokers and you will need to keep track of all the paperwork and if it has been sent in, along with which broker has paid you and which has not.
      The other big advantage that we see is that you are not liable for an unpaid invoice, there is no recourse.
      Why would you factor instead of using quick-pay?
      The biggest advantage to factoring is that you can factor in any credit-approved broker, which opens up your options and allows you to take any load you want versus only using a broker who offers quick pay.
      You do not need to be so organized, your M&J Dispatcher will send all the paperwork to your factoring company (for an additional fee) and all your invoices will be in one place.
      You will get paid FASTER! Most times it is the same day or the next day at the latest.
      Factoring is usually more affordable because you are charged the same rate with each invoice versus having a different rate depending on which broker you are quick-paying with.
      Bottom Line:  You need to do what is BEST for your business.  If you need help making this decision, let us know at M&J Dispatch and we will help guide you to make the best choice for your trucking business.`

As small business owners with other full time jobs we just didn’t have the time to do our own dispatching and Matt and his team have taken a huge weight off us so that we can concentrate on building our company. As a new authority we had a lot of broker contracts to get, which meant sending a lot of broker packets off and Matt and his team have done all of that for us…another huge workload that we didn’t have to deal with and something we really appreciate.
