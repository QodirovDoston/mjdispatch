      "MAKING MORE MONEY THAN EVER!! We‚Äôve been using M&J for dispatching our truck for a few months now and we could tell the difference from the first week. We were making more money than we had ever made before and it still continues. As small business owners with other full time jobs we just didn‚Äôt have the time to do our own dispatching and Matt and his team have taken a huge weight off us so that we can concentrate on building our company. As a new authority we had a lot of broker contracts to get, which meant sending a lot of broker packets off and Matt and his team have done all of that for us‚Ä¶another huge workload that we didn‚Äôt have to deal with and something we really appreciate. I can‚Äôt recommend this company highly enough for truck dispatching, they really saved us when things weren‚Äôt looking too good. A first class company!",
